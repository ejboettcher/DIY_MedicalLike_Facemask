#### Cut the cloth
Use a sheet of paper for your template.  Cut two pieces of cloth the size of a sheet of paper.

**NOTE** The outer cloth should be cotton or linen to absorb moisture!

#### (Optional) Moisture Spacer / Wiching Barrier
I wanted my mask to have the following (unproven) features:
* A moisture wicking barrier.  Here I added another *middle* layer using netting.
  ![square with netting](./images/squareWithNetting.jpg)
* Have two types of material with different tribostatics: e.g. take or give an elections.  My (UNPROVEN) theory is that when the air moves across the two barriers it would self ionize.  Again it is UNPROVEN.

#### Sew Top Edge
Fold over the **A** single short side of the cloth and sew the edge down.  We are going to call this the top side

We want a clean edge to make a pocket for adding additional filters.

#### ADD: Bag tie pocket
One ONE of the folded sewn edges we will add a pocket for the bag tie.
The bag tie will allow us to mold the mask to our nose.  I used a ribbon to make a pocket for the bag tie

#### Fold Fabric
Folder the fabric (while in portrait mode) like a cummerbund.  Have the cummberbund creases *pointing to the bottom*.  

#### (OPTIONAL) Iron Folds Flat
At this point, you can fold the mask like a cummerbund and iron to make nice creases.

This will make life easier, but I dislike ironing.

#### Sew the two cloth pieces together at bottom
Align the two sewn edges, with the **nice** side of the fabric facing each other.  

Then sew the two pieces together at the other short end.


#### Flip right side out and sew sides
Flip the fabric, right side out and sew the two sides.

#### (OPTIONAL) Sew Bottom again
For a cleaner looking edge, you can sew dew the bottom end.

#### Sew the top side
We are going to sew the top of the mask **but** leave room for adding additional filters and bag tie

#### Add Ribbon / Elastic holder
Fold the ribbon in half and sew it onto each ends of the mask.  This makes a slot for the ribbon or elastic to attach to the mask.

#### Add Elastic or ribbon
Add elastic or ribbon for ear loops of head ties

Note a crochet hook makes threading the ribbon or elastic easier.

## NOTICE / WARNING
I make NO CLAIMS that these masks will protect you from covid19. Use at your own risk.  These are not Medical Mask.
