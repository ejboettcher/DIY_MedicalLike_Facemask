This produces a very simple and fast to make cloth mask.  Adjust size as needed.


If you are a good seamtress and have supplies please take a look at [my favorite][favorite_DIY].  It looks awesome!  Also if you are more cautious you can use the [CDC Mask instructions][CDC_mask].

For the rest of us with random supplies and lower skills, then this page is for you.

#### Cut the Cloth
Use a sheet of paper for your template.  Cut a single pieces of cloth the size of a sheet of paper.
You do not have to be exact, simply within the ballpark.  Make larger or smaller for your head.

From here our I will refer to this a the *square*.

| GOOD Cut  | BAD Cut |
|:---:|:---:|

**NOTE** The outer cloth should be cotton or linen to absorb moisture!

#### (Optional) Moisture Spacer / Wicking Barrier
I wanted my mask to have the following (unproven) features:
* A moisture wicking barrier.  Here I added another *middle* layer using netting.
  ![square with netting](./images/squareWithNetting.jpg)
* Have two types of material with different tribostatics: e.g. take or give an elections.  My (UNPROVEN) theory is that when the air moves across the two barriers it would self ionize.  Again it is UNPROVEN.


#### ADD: Bag tie pocket
One ONE of the short edges of the *square* we will add a pocket for the bag tie.
The bag tie will allow us to mold the mask to our nose.  I used a ribbon to make a pocket for the bag tie

#### Fold Fabric in behalf
Folder the fabric (while in portrait mode) in half.  You want the **WIDTH** to be 8.5 inches across.  You also want the *right* (nice) side of the fabric facing **out**.

#### Fold Fabric like a cummberbund
 like a cummerbund.  Have the cummberbund creases *pointing to the bottom*.

#### Sew the side edges together
Sew both sides.
(Optional) Zig-zag stitch here is nice to use.


#### (OPTIONAL) Sew Bottom
For a cleaner looking edge, you can sew the bottom end.

#### Add Ties or Elastic
What you do here depends on the material you have.  

**NOTE** You may want to add a pocket at the top so that users can add additional filters.

##### If you have ribbon or cloth edges.
Sew the the ties onto the mask see image below.

##### If you have ribbon Elastic holder and 1 1/2" ribbon
Fold the ribbon in half and sew it onto each ends of the mask.  This makes a slot for the ribbon or elastic to attach to the mask.
Note a crochet hook makes threading the ribbon or elastic easier.

#### Done
Note the slot for the bag tie to make a good fit around the nose.
