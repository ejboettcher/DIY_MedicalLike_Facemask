Cut the band, strap and top pieces of cloth.
For the top piece round the corners but leave the bottom flat.

You do not have to be exact, simply within the ballpark.  Make larger or smaller for your head.

#### (Optional) Iron the bias tape
Fold the bias tape in 1/2 and then fold inwards the tape so that it is about 1/2" wide.  Your life will be much easier if you iron it flat.

#### Sew the band and top together
Starting in the middle of the flat part of the top piece, sew the band and top piesce together.  Have the *nice/right* side facing together. Leave about 1/4 inch of the band


#### Sew Halfway down the band
Sew halfway down the band


#### Cut Each side of the bottom band in half, then sew the edges
Cut each side of the band at a 45 degree angle.  Then fold over the freshly cut edges and sew them down.

#### Sew the Bias Tape on
Find the middle of the bias tape and the skull cap and pin it together.  Then slid the tape against the fabric till you come to the end.  Then pin it to the cap's band.  At one end of the bias tap, start sewing the bias tape together.

#### Add Strap to hold faceshield on
Fold the cap in half, measure 5" from the top end.  Sew the strap perpendicular to the bias tape. There should be about 1 1/4 gap between the top and bottom of the strap.  Or use a US Quarter to measure the spacing for the gap.
